	We report novel modifications to the composite microstructure of the exoskeleton in the snout of acorn weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) belonging to the genus \textit{Curculio} Linnaeus, 1756.

	As a weevil (snout beetle), members of the genus \textit{Curculio} are typified by the presence of a highly elongate structure on the head, called the rostrum (snout). 
	This structure is a hollow, strongly curved (over 90$\degree$), cylindrical extension of the exoskeleton of the otherwise nearly-spherical head, which bears at its apex the terminal chewing mouthparts. 
	The space inside of the rostrum contains the esophagus, various muscles and tendons used for feeding, and hemolymph that serves as a rough equivalent to blood in insects.
	By contrast, the solid shell of the rostrum is comprised entirely of cuticle, which can be considered a laminate composite consisting of various arrangements of chitin fibers embedded in a protein matrix (see \cref{sec:microstructure}).
	Acorn weevils use this structure to excavate sites for egg-laying (oviposition) and feeding on a variety of fruits, including acorns, Japanese camellia, hazelnuts, pecans, chestnuts, and chinquapins. 
		
	During oviposition, a female engages in a unique "drilling" behavior that causes significant, apparently elastic, deformation of the rostrum.
	The female will insert the snout into an incision made with the mandibles, eating the material as she proceeds, while rotating her head and body around the perimeter of the bore-hole.
	Once the apex of the snout is fully inserted, she will push up and forward with her front legs, forcing the rostrum to bend until it is nearly straight.
	The female will maintain tension on the rostrum in this position, continuing to ingest the substrate and rotate around the bore-hole, while slowly inserting the rostrum further into the excavated channel.
	Once the rostrum is fully inserted, usually up to the eyes, she will pull her snout from the bore-hole and deposit several eggs into the site.
	By maintaining constant tension on the rostrum and rotating around the bore-hole, the female is able to flex the snout into a near-perfectly straight configuration and thereby produce a linear channel into the fruit.
	While this behavior has been observed in many species of \textit{Curculio}, we have lacked a fundamental understanding of how female \textit{Curculio} rostra can withstand the repeated, often extreme bending incurred during the process of oviposition.

	We have found that the composite profile of the rostrum is strongly differentiated from the head capsule and other body parts, with modification of both the relative layer thicknesses and fiber orientation angles of cuticle regions (viz. exocuticle and endocuticle), which we describe in detail below.
	We posit that these modifications enable the snout to be flexed until straight while remaining within the elastic limits of the material, mitigating the risk of structural damage, and without evident alteration of the mechanical properties of the individual components of the cuticle across the structure and between species.
	Thus, the flexibility and tensile strength of the rostrum appear to be derived \emph{exclusively} from modification of the composite architecture of the exoskeleton.
	
	Support for this hypothesis has come from three lines of evidence:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Examination of the cuticle microstructure across the length of the snout has revealed consistent modification to the composite structure of the rostrum among \textit{Curculio} species.
	\item Tensile testing of the rostrum has demonstrated that the mechanical strength of the cuticle components are consistent along the length of the structure and between species.
	\item Fatigue testing has shown that a highly curved rostrum is capable of flexing hundreds of thousands of times without damage to the structure, and is apparently elastic.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	We additionally describe the fracture mechanics of the snout, as pertains to both cuticle composite structure and tensile behavior, and consider how modification of the cuticle may reduce the risk of rostral fracture during oviposition.
	To our knowledge, this is the first time that a modified composite profile has been reported as a means of enhancing structural elasticity in the insect exoskeleton.

	MIGHT BE GOOD TO SIGNPOST HERE... we discuss each of these lines of evidence in the sections below beginning with a consideration of the impact of microstructure, then we talk about mechanical testing, blah blah. Emphasize that this is key to predicting and understanding the mechanical behavior of the snout during bending.

		Insect cuticle is made up of chitin and numerous uncharacterized proteins, which effectively act as a matrix into which the chitin is embedded \cite{Nikolov2011,Nikolov2010,Vincent2004}.
		The arrangement of the embedded chitin fibers is primarily responsible for the mechanical behavior of the cuticle, although this is modulated by the degree of tanning and water retention. \cite{Klocke2011,Vincent2004}.	
		Accordingly, cuticle is often considered as a fiber-reinforced composite material; however, in beetles, the composite arrangement of the chitin fibers varies by cuticle region.	
	
		Insect cuticle is divisible into three regions (Figs.~INSERT-REFS-HERE), including (1) endocuticle, which is the most compliant and innermost region; and (3) exocuticle, which is the stiffest, hardest, and outermost region.
		Between these lies (2) mesocuticle, which is similar in microstructure to exocuticle, but less sclerotized (tanned), usually acting as a thin transition zone \cite{Klocke2011,Vincent1982,Vincent2004}.
		
		In general, these regions are confluent, and not necessarily sharply defined; for instance, mesocuticle is not always evident, and is sometimes considered part of the exocuticle.
		In beetles, both exocuticle and mesocuticle (when present) are laminate, and have numerous laminae of unidirectional chitin fibers, each layer a single fiber thick (2-4nm), embedded in a proteinaceous matrix.
		These layers are stacked at a more or less constant angle to each other in a helicoidal arrangement, referred to as the Bouligand structure \cite{Blackwell1980,Bouligand1972,Neville1976}. 
		This microstructure allows exocuticle and mesocuticle to exhibit transverse isotropy, or complete isotropy in some cases, despite the strong anisotropy of $\alpha$-chitin.
		
		Conversely, the endocuticle of Coleoptera appears to take advantage of this anisotropy to improve fracture resistance of the exoskeleton.
		Beetles in particular have a highly modified endocuticle comprised of large (5-20$\mu$m OD) unidirectional bundles of chitin, called macrofibers.
		Macrofibers are aligned in layers, as in Figs~INSERT-FIGS-HERE \cite{Kamp2010,Kamp2015}.
		Typically, endocuticle contains several layers of macrofibers, with the adjacent layers forming pairs. 
		The layers \emph{within} each pair are pseudo-orthogonal (i.e., angled approx. $90\degree$ to each other, see Figs.~INSERT-REFS-HERE), while the stacking angle \emph{between} pairs is typically acute, although other configurations have been observed \cite{Hepburn1973,Kamp2010}.
		It is thought that this arrangement of the macrofibers contributes to the toughness of beetle exoskeletons by inhibiting crack formation and propagation between successive plies \cite{Kamp2010,Kamp2015,Hepburn1973}.		
		
		We have found that in \textit{Curculio}, the head capsule (which is similar to the rest of the body) fits the general profile of endocuticle, with an angle of approximately $30\degree$ between successive pseudo-orthogonal plies.
		Additionally, in the head capsule, the thickness of the exocuticle in cross section is nearly equal to that of the endocuticle; compared to the snout, this part of the head is fairly rigid.
		
		By contrast, the region beyond the scrobe (antennal channel) is quite flexible, even in fully desiccated specimens.
		Serial thin sectioning of the snout has demonstrated that the cuticle in this region has a different composite structure (see Fig~INSERT-REFS-HERE) than the head capsule, namely:

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The exocuticle is reduced to a thin shell, with the endocuticle thickened to offset this reduction.
			\item The endocuticular macrofibers exhibit no rotation between successive pseudo-orthogonal plies, which are all oriented at approx. $\pm45\degree$ to the longitudinal axis of the snout.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		Correspondingly, the portion of the snout between the head capsule and apex of the scrobe exhibits a gradual transition in composite profile along an anterior-posterior gradient.		
		In previous work we identified these modifications to the composite structure of the cuticle, but only within a single species, \textit{C. longinasus} Chittenden, 1927 \cite{Jansen2016, Singh2016}.
		This composite profile has now been uncovered in the rostral apex of six additional, phylogenetically disparate, species (listed below), indicating that this is likely a genus-wide trait.
		
		Notably, we could find no evidence of resilin, as indicated by florescent microscopy, anywhere in the cuticle of the head (including the rostrum).
		We also observed no difference in total cuticle thickness between the head capsule and rostral apex, only differences in relative layer thicknesses.
		Below we demonstrate that that the endocuticle does not vary in tensile strength across the rostrum, making it unlikely that differences in sclerotization or chitin composition within the cuticle are responsible for the mechanical behavior of the rostrum.
		The available evidence therefore suggests that the relative flexibility of the snout is solely derived from the composite profile of its cuticle.
	
	\section{Tensile testing and fracture mechanics} %shoot for 600 words
		Based on our understanding of the microstructure of the cuticle, it is possible to make several predictions about the mechanical behavior of the snout.
		First, we can predict that the endocuticle will contribute more to the tensile strength of the rostrum than the exocuticle, because the endocuticle is organized in large bundles of aligned, anisotropic fibers.
		Second, the endocuticle will be less brittle than the exocuticle, therefore we should expect that fractures will initiate in the exocuticle.
		The predicted behavior of the snout is borne out by the data, where UTS is strongly correlated with the cross-sectional area of the endocuticle across species.
		In addition to making the cuticle flexible, this profile makes it less likely to break, suggesting a possible means by which the system evolved (negative selection of breakage, maybe say this in conclusions).
		
		Outline:
		Intro
			To better characterize the mechanical behavior of the snout as an integrated whole, we performed tensile testing on the heads of 6 species in the genus \textit{Curculio}, representing a mixture of closely and distantly related taxa.
		Tensile testing
			We observed that the maximum force sustained at the site of the break was strongly correlated with the cross-sectional area of the endocuticle, and not the exocuticle.
			Consequently, there was a negative correlation between utlimate tensile strenth of the specimen and the ratio of exocuticle to endocuticle cross-sectional area at the site of fracture, indicating that as the proportion of exocuticle increased, tensile strength decreased.
			 All of these associations were found to be statistically significant and independent of species membership, rostrum length, and location on the snout.
			 
			This strongly suggests that there is very little variation in the gross elastic behavior of the cuticle across the genus, in agreement with our current understanding of cuticle mechanobiology.

			\paragraph*{General approach}
				To explore the relationships between the composite structure and mechanical properties of the cuticle, we fit phylogenetic linear mixed-effects models to the data using maximum likelihood estimation.
				In order to control for phylogenetic non-independence in the data, we included the species of each specimen as a random effect in all models.
				We also allowed for correlation in the error term of the models, as specified by a variance-covariance matrix generated from a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along the phylogeny.
				Response variables and covariates were natural-log transformed, as needed, to ensure model residuals were normally distributed and homoscedastic.
				In all models, we tested whether the inclusion of phylogenetic correlation in the model error produced significantly better model fit, using a likelihood-ratio test and $R^{2}_{\sigma}$-difference test between the fully-specified model and a model lacking the phylogenetic effect.
			\paragraph*{Hypothesis testing}
				The following three hypotheses were tested using PGLMMs fitted using ML estimation:
				\begin{enumerate}
				\item The maximum sustained tensile force is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the endocuticle, and \emph{not} that of the exocuticle.
				\item The ultimate tensile strength of the samples is inversely proportional to the ratio of exocuticle to endocuticle at the location of fracture.
				\item Young's modulus of the samples is proportional to the length of the snout.
				\end{enumerate}
				
				We fitted a fully-specified model with the cross-sectional area of endocuticle and exocuticle at the site of fracture as fixed effects, including an interaction term, and with maximum tensile force sustained prior to fracture as a response variable.
				This model was then compared to models with only cross-sectional area of either endocuticle or exocuticle as the sole fixed effect in the model.
				We then tested the first hypothesis by using likelihood-ratio tests and $R^{2}_{\beta*}$-difference tests between each of the three models.
